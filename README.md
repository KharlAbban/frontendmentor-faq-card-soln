## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) - CSS Framework
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This one really tested my understanding of CSS positions and display properties. I had fun working out
how to use the @media queries to size and display different elements.


### Continued development

Next step is to fine-tune the desktop layout so thatthe images on the left are displayed correctly.
